# PEPEUSDT Trading Plan  
**Execution Time Horizon**: Next 1-3 Days (Valid until 2025-05-18 22:26:58)  

---

## 1. Strategy Rationale  
This plan capitalizes on PEPE's current consolidation phase between $0.00001291 (24hr low) and $0.00001394 (recent resistance). The medium-term bullish trend (65% gain since May 1) suggests underlying strength, while the short-term bearish rejection at $0.00001480 creates a high-probability swing trading opportunity. Declining volume indicates potential exhaustion in selling pressure, favoring a rebound scenario if support holds.

## 2. Entry Conditions/Price Zones  
**Primary Entry (Long Position)**:  
- **Conservative**: $0.00001304 (S1 support) with bullish reversal confirmation (e.g., 15-minute candle close above $0.00001320 + rising volume)  
- **Aggressive**: Breakout above $0.00001394 (R1) with volume >$100M USD/15min  

**Secondary Entry (Scalp Short)**:  
- Only if price rejects at $0.00001394 (R1) with declining RSI on lower timeframes  

---

## 3. Take-Profit Targets  
**Primary Long Targets**:  
- **TP1**: $0.00001360 (4.2% gain from S1 entry, aligns with Walletinvestor prediction)  
- **TP2**: $0.00001394 (6.9% gain, recent resistance level)  
- **TP3**: $0.00001430 (Partial exit at 9.7% gain if R2 breakout momentum strengthens)  

**Short Scalp Target**:  
- $0.00001304 (3.0% profit from R1 rejection)  

---

## 4. Stop-Loss Level  
- **Long Positions**: $0.00001280 (3.0% below S2, accounts for volatility below 24hr low)  
- **Short Positions**: $0.00001410 (1.1% above R1 to avoid false breakout traps)  

---

## 5. Confidence Level  
**Medium** (6/10)  
- Strengthened by clear S/R levels and medium-term bullish bias  
- Limited by recent volume decline and meme coin sentiment risks  

---

## 6. Potential Risks  
- **Regulatory Headwinds**: New SEC guidance could trigger sector-wide selloff  
- **False Breakouts**: Low volume may invalidate R1/S1 levels faster than expected  
- **BTC Correlation**: >2% BTC drop within 24hrs could override PEPE's technicals  
- **Liquidity Gaps**: Order book thinness below $0.00001280 may exacerbate losses

**Risk-Reward Ratio**: 1:2.5 (Conservative entry to TP1) | 1:4.5 (Full TP3 scenario)  
**Position Sizing Recommendation**: â‰¤3% portfolio allocation due to extreme volatility
